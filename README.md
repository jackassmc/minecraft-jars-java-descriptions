# Minecraft Jars Java Descriptions

This repo contains the Java descriptions of all Minecraft jars as Tiny v2 mapping files.
Bundled jars (like the new server jars) are unbundled but otherwise jars in jars are ignored.

Minecraft jars (client, server and windows_server) are collected from the version.json files from
[MultiMC meta-upstream](https://github.com/MultiMC/meta-upstream).
This is necessary because the launcher version manifest does not contain experimental snapshots.
Thanks MultiMC!

Java descriptions are read with a [Fabric mapping-io](https://github.com/FabricMC/mapping-io) based
[CLI](https://github.com/jackassmc/mapping-io).
